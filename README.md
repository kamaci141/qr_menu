# QR Menu Setup Instructions

## Overview
This is a simple QR menu for your small business, displaying main courses, desserts, and coffee products.

## Files
- `index.html`: The menu webpage

## Testing Locally
1. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the menu.

## Hosting Online
To make the menu accessible via QR code, you need to host it online. Here's how using GitHub Pages (free):

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g., `qr-menu`).
2. Upload `index.html` to the repository.
3. Go to Settings > Pages in your repository.
4. Under Source, select "Deploy from a branch".
5. Select the main branch and click Save.
6. GitHub will provide a URL like `https://yourusername.github.io/qr-menu/`.

## Generating QR Code
Once hosted, you can generate a QR code that points to your menu URL:

1. Go to an online QR code generator (e.g., qr-code-generator.com).
2. Enter your hosted URL.
3. Download the QR code image.
4. Print it or display it in your business.

## Customizing the Menu
Edit `index.html` to update menu items, prices, or styling. The sample items are placeholders - replace them with your actual menu.
